They shall not form part of the Contract or have any contractual force.</li>

<li> M Squared shall use reasonable endeavours to provide Services to Customer, in accordance with the applicable Order Acknowledgement in all material respects.</li>
<li> M Squared shall use reasonable endeavours to meet any performance dates specified in the applicable Order Acknowledgement, but any such dates shall be estimates only and time for performance by M Squared shall not be of the essence of the Contract.</li>
</ol>

<h1>5. CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS </h1>
<ol><li>Customer shall:</li>

<li> co-operate with M Squared in all matters relating to Services;</li>

<li> provide, in a timely manner, such In-put Material and other information as M Squared may require;</li>

<li> provide, for M Squared, its agents, subcontractors, consultants and employees, in a timely manner and at no charge, access to Customer’s premises, office accommodation, data and other facilities as required by M Squared or any of them;</li>

<li> be responsible (at its own cost) for preparing and maintaining the relevant premises for the supply of Services;</li>

<li> inform M Squared of all health and safety rules and regulations and any other reasonable security requirements that apply at Customer’s premises;
</li>

<li> ensure that all Customer’s Equipment is in good working order and suitable for the purposes for which it is used in relation to Services and conforms to all relevant standards or requirements; </li>

<li> obtain and maintain all necessary licences and consents and comply with all relevant legislation in relation to Services, the installation of M Squared’s Equipment, the use of In-put Material and the use of Customer’s Equipment in relation to M Squared’s Equipment insofar as such licences, consents and legislation relate to Customer’s business, premises, staff and equipment, in all cases before the date on which Services are to start; and</li>

<li> keep, maintain and insure M Squared’s Equipment in accordance with M Squared’s instructions as notified by M Squared from time to time and shall not dispose of or use M Squared’s Equipment other than in accordance with M Squared’s written instructions or authorisation.</li>

<li>If M Squared’s performance of its obligations under the Contract is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of Customer, its agents, subcontractors, consultants or employees, M Squared shall not be liable for any costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by Customer that arise directly or indirectly from such prevention or delay.</li>

<li>Customer shall be liable to pay to M Squared, on demand, all reasonable costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by M Squared (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit and loss of reputation, loss or damage to property and those arising from injury to or death of any person and loss of opportunity to deploy resources elsewhere) that arise directly or indirectly from Customer’s fraud, negligence, failure to perform or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under the Contract, subject to M Squared confirming such costs, charges and losses to Customer in writing.</li>

<li> Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of M Squared, at any time from the commencement of Services to the expiry of 12 months after the last date of supply of Services, solicit or entice away from M Squared or employ or attempt to employ any person who is, or has been, engaged as an employee, consultant or subcontractor of M Squared in the provision of Services.</li>

<li> Any consent given by M Squared in accordance with clause 5.4 shall be subject to Customer paying to M Squared a sum equivalent to 20% of the then current annual remuneration of M Squared’s employee, consultant or subcontractor or, if higher, 20% of the annual remuneration to be paid by Customer to that employee, consultant or subcontractor.</li>
</ol>
<h1>6. CHANGES TO SERVICES</h1>
<ol>

<li> If either party wishes to make changes to the scope or execution of Services (including any terms of the applicable Order Acknowledgement), it shall submit details of the requested change to the other in writing (for which email shall be sufficient). If such either party requests a change to the scope or execution of Services (including any changes to the applicable Order Acknowledgement), M Squared shall, within a reasonable time, provide a written estimate to Customer of:</li> 

<li>the likely time required to implement the change;</li>

<li>any necessary variations to M Squared’s charges arising from the change; and</li>

<li> any other impact of the change to the Contract.</li>

<li> If Customer wishes M Squared to proceed with the change, M Squared has no obligation to do so unless and until the parties have agreed the necessary variations to its charges and the scope of Services and any other relevant terms of the Contract to take account of the change and the Contract has been varied.</li>
<li> Notwithstanding clause 6.2, M Squared may, from time to time and without notice, change Services in order to comply with any applicable safety or statutory requirements, provided that such changes do not materially affect the nature, scope of, or the charges for Services. M Squared may, from time to time and subject to Customer’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, change Services, provided that such changes do not materially affect the nature or quality of Services and, where practicable, it will give Customer at least 1 months’ notice of any change.</li>

<li> M Squared may charge for the time it spends assessing a request for change from Customer in accordance with M Squared’s daily rate as notified in terms of the applicable Order Acknowledgement.</li>

<li> In consideration of the provision of Services by M Squared, Customer shall pay the charges as set out in the applicable Order Acknowledgement or, if no charge is quoted, the charges set out in M Squared’s published price list for consultancy services in force as at the date of commencement of Services (or as otherwise agreed from time to time by the parties in writing).</li>
<li> Any price contained in the applicable Order Acknowledgement excludes:</li>

<li> the cost of hotel, subsistence, travelling and any other ancillary expenses reasonably incurred by the individuals whom M Squared engages in connection with Services, the cost of any materials and the cost of services reasonably and properly provided by third parties and required by M Squared for the supply of Services. Such expenses, materials and third party services shall be invoiced by M Squared at cost; and</li>

<li>VAT or other applicable sales tax, which M Squared shall add to its invoices at the appropriate rate if required.</li>

<li>Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Order Acknowledgement, M Squared may invoice Customer for Services on or at any time after the completion of Services.</li> 

<li>Customer shall pay the invoice in full and in cleared funds 10 Business Days of the date of the invoice. Payment shall be made to the bank account nominated in writing by M Squared. Time of payment is of the essence.</li>

<li> If Customer fails to make any payment due to M Squared under the Contract by the due date for payment (<b>Due Date</b>), then Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 3% per annum above Barclays Bank Plc’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the Due Date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.</li>

<li> Customer shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any deduction or withholding except as required by law and Customer shall not be entitled to assert any credit, set-off or counterclaim against M Squared in order to justify withholding payment of any such amount in whole or in part. M Squared may at any time, without limiting any other rights or remedies it may have, set off any amount owing to it by Customer against any amount payable by M Squared to Customer.</li>
</ol>
<h1>8. CONFIDENTIALITY</h1>
<ol>
<li>Customer shall keep in strict confidence all technical or commercial know-how, specifications, inventions, processes or initiatives which are of a confidential nature and have been disclosed to Customer by M Squared, its employees, agents, consultants or subcontractors and any other confidential information concerning M Squared’s business or its products which Customer may obtain.</li>

<li> Customer may disclose such information:</li>  

<li> to its employees, officers, representatives, advisers, agents or subcontractors who need to know such information for the purposes of carrying out Customer’s obligations under the Contract or in utilising Deliverables; and </li>

<li> as may be required by law, court order or any governmental or regulatory authority.</li>

<li> Customer shall use its best endeavours to ensure that its employees, officers, representatives, advisers, agents or subcontractors to whom it discloses such information comply with this clause 8.</li> 

<li> Customer acknowledges that violations of the covenants and obligations in this clause 8 may cause M Squared irreparable injury for which an adequate remedy at law may not be available. Therefore, M Squared shall be entitled to seek all remedies that may be available including immediate injunctive relief, in addition to whatever remedies may be available at law.</li>
</ol>
<h1>9. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h1>
<ol>
<li> As between Customer and M Squared, all Intellectual Property Rights and all other rights in Deliverables and the Pre-Existing Materials shall be owned by and automatically vest in M Squared. M Squared licenses such Intellectual Property Rights to Customer free of charge and on a non-exclusive, worldwide basis to such extent as is necessary to enable Customer to make reasonable use of the Deliverables and Services. If the Contract is terminated for cause due to Customer’s default, this licence will automatically terminate.</li>
</ol>

<h1>10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h1>
<ol>
<li> This clause 10 sets out the entire financial liability of M Squared (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors) to Customer in respect of:</li>

<li> any breach of the Contract however arising; </li>

<li> any use made by Customer of Services, the Deliverables or any part of them; and  </li>

<li>any representation, statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with the Contract.</li>
<li>All warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or common law are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the Contract.</li>

<li> Nothing in the Contract limits or excludes the liability of M Squared:</li>

<li> for death or personal injury resulting from its negligence;</li> 

<li> fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</li>
<li> any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for M Squared to exclude or restrict liability.</li>

<li> Subject to clause 10.3:</li>

<li> M Squared shall not under any circumstances whatever be liable for:</li>
</ol>
<ol><li> loss of profits;</li>
    <li> loss of business;</li>
   <li> depletion of goodwill and/or similar losses;</li>
   <li> loss of anticipated savings;</li>
   <li> loss of goods;</li>
 <li> loss of contract;</li>
   <li> loss of use;</li>
    <li> loss of corruption of data or information; or</li>
<li> any special, indirect, consequential or pure economic loss, costs, </li>
</ol>
<ol><li>
    damages, charges or expenses; and</li>

<li> M Squared’s total liability in contract, delict/tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Contract shall in all circumstances not exceed 135% of the fees paid for Services.</li>
</ol>

<h1>11. EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION</h1>
<ol>
<li> <b>Termination for Cause.</b> Either party will have the right to terminate the Contract if the other party breaches any material term of the Contract (including the applicable Order Acknowledgement) and if such breach is capable of cure, the breaching party fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. Either party will have the right to terminate the Contract if the other becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a trustee or receiver is appointed for such other party or for a substantial part of its assets, or bankruptcy, reorganisation or insolvency proceedings shall be instituted by or against such other party, or an event occurs, or proceedings are taken, with respect to either party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any events mentioned in this clause 11. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of the Contract under this clause 11 terminates the applicable Order Acknowledgement and all licenses granted by M Squared to Customer hereunder.</li>
<li><b>Effect of Termination.</b> On termination or expiration of the Contract for any reason other than breach caused solely by M Squared: </li>
<li>Customer shall immediately pay to M Squared all of M Squared’s outstanding unpaid invoices and interest and, in respect of Services supplied but for which no invoice has been submitted, M Squared may submit an invoice, which shall be payable immediately on receipt; </li>
<li> the accrued rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of the parties as at termination shall not be affected, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Contract which existed at or before the date of termination; and</li>

<li> clauses which expressly or by implication have effect after termination shall continue in full force and effect, including the following clauses: clause 8 (Confidentiality), clause 9 (Intellectual Property Rights), clause 10 (Limitation of Liability), clause 11.2.3, clause 12.3 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction) and clause 12.6 (Notices).
</li>
</ol>
<h1>12. GENERAL</h1>
<ol>
<li> <b>Marketing.</b> Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Acknowledgement, Customer agrees that M Squared may use Customer’s name and logo (in a form Customer approves) to identify Customer as a customer on M Squared’s website or in marketing or publicity materials.</li>

<li><b> Transfer of Rights and Obligations.</b> Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of M Squared, assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract, or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Contract. M Squared may at any time assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract, or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Contract. Each party that has rights under the Contract is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of another person.</li>

<li> <b>Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</b> The Contract and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of Scotland. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Scotland shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the Contract or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</li> 

<li><b> Nonexclusive Remedy. </b>Except as expressly set forth in the Contract, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Contract will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Contract or otherwise.</li>

<li><b> Force Majeure.</b> Neither party will be responsible for any failure or delay in its performance under the Contract (except for any payment obligations) due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, labour disputes, strikes, lockouts, shortages of or inability to obtain labour, energy, raw materials or supplies, war, terrorism, riot, natural disasters or governmental action.</li>

<li><b>Notices.</b> All notices required or permitted under the Contract will be in writing. Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly received: (a) if delivered personally, when left at the address; (b) if sent by pre-paid first-class post or recorded delivery, at 9.00 am on the second business day after posting; or (c) if delivered by commercial courier, on the date and at the time that the courier’s delivery receipt is signed. Notices relating to the Contract will be sent to the primary corporate addresses set forth in the applicable Order Acknowledgement or to such other address as Customer or M Squared may notify the other party in writing.</li>

<li> <b>Entire Agreement.</b>The Contract, including any applicable Order Acknowledgement referencing these Terms and Conditions, constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between Customer and M Squared regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, relating to its subject matter. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into the Contract it does not rely on any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether it was made negligently or innocently) of any person (whether a party to the Contract or not) (<b>Representation</b>) other than as expressly set out in the Contract. Each party agrees that the only rights and remedies available to it arising out of or in connection with a Representation shall be for breach of contract. Nothing in this clause 12.7 shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.</li>

<li> <b>Modification; Severability.</b> Failure to enforce any provision of the Contract will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of the Contract will be effective only if in writing and signed by an officer of Customer and an authorised representative of M Squared. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Contract invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the Contract will remain in full force and effect.</li> 

<li><b> No Partnership or Agency.</b> Nothing in Contract is intended to, or shall operate to, create a partnership between the parties, or to authorise either party to act as agent for the other, and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).
