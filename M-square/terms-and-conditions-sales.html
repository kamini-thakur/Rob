                        <p><b>3.1</b> These Terms and Conditions apply to the Contract to the exclusion of any other terms that Customer seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the terms and conditions, if any, in any communication from Customer, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail.</p>

<p><b>3.2</b> The Order constitutes an offer by Customer to purchase Goods in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. Customer is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the Order and any applicable Specification are complete and accurate.</p>

<p><b>3.3</b> The Order shall only be deemed to be accepted when M Squared issues the applicable Order Acknowledgement, at which point the Contract shall come into existence.</p>

<p><b>3.4</b> Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter, or advertising produced by M Squared and any descriptions or illustrations contained in M Squared’s catalogues or brochures are produced for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of Goods described in them. They shall not form part of the Contract or have any contractual force. </p>

<p><b>3.5</b> A quotation for Goods given by M Squared shall not constitute an offer. Unless the parties agree otherwise, a quotation shall only be valid for a period of 30 days from its date of issue. All quotations given by M Squared are based on the cost of production of Goods current on the date of quotation and are, in accordance with clause 10.2, subject to adjustments by M Squared on or after acceptance by M Squared of Customer’s order.</li>
</p>

<h3>4. CREDIT APPROVAL</h3>
<p><b>4.1</b>  Unless otherwise agreed in writing between M Squared and Customer, acceptance of each Order is subject to the condition that M Squared obtains satisfactory credit approval from its credit insurers for such Order and in the event of such approval not being granted, in terms which M Squared in its sole discretion considers satisfactory, M Squared may by notice in writing intimate to Customer that such condition has not been satisfied. In that event M Squared shall not in any circumstances incur any liability to Customer in respect of any matters directly or indirectly related to such Order.</p>

<h3>5. DELIVERY</h3>
<p><b>5.1</b> M Squared shall ensure that: </p>

<p><b>5.1.1</b> each delivery of Goods is accompanied by a delivery note which shows the date of the Order, all relevant Customer and M Squared reference numbers, the type and quantity of Goods (including the code number of Goods, where applicable), special storage instructions (if any) and, if the Order is being delivered by instalments, the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered; and </p>

<p><b>5.1.2</b> if M Squared requires Customer to return any packaging materials to M Squared, that fact is clearly stated on the delivery note.

<p><b>5.3</b> Delivery of Goods shall be completed on Goods’ arrival at the Delivery Address.</p>

<p><b>5.4</b> Any dates quoted for delivery of Goods are approximate only, and the time of delivery of Goods is not of the essence.

<p><b>5.5</b> If M Squared fails to deliver Goods, its liability shall be limited to the costs and expenses incurred by Customer in obtaining replacement goods of similar description and quality in the cheapest market available, less the price of Goods.</p>

<p><b>5.6</b> If Customer fails to take delivery of Goods within 3 Business Days of M Squared notifying Customer that Goods are ready, then, except where such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event or M Squared’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Contract: </p>

<p><b>5.8</b> Squared may deliver Goods by instalments. Such Goods which shall be invoiced and paid for separately. Each instalment shall constitute a separate Contract. Any delay in delivery or defect in an instalment shall not entitle Customer to cancel any other instalment.</p>


<h3>6. CANCELLATION</h3>

<p><b>8.3.1</b> Customer makes any further use of such Goods after giving notice in accordance with clause 8.2;</p> 

<p><b>8.3.2</b> the defect arises because Customer failed to follow M Squared’s oral or written instructions as to the storage, commissioning, installation, use and maintenance of Goods or (if there are none) good trade practice regarding the same;</p>  

<p><b>8.3.3</b> the defect arises as a result of M Squared following any drawing, design or Specification supplied by Customer; </p>

<p><b>8.3.4</b> Customer alters or repairs such Goods without the written consent of M Squared;</p>

<p><b>8.4</b> Except as provided in this clause 8, M Squared shall have no liability to Customer in respect of Goods’ failure to comply with the warranty set out in clause 8.1.</p>

<p><b>9.3.4</b> maintain Goods in satisfactory condition and keep them insured against all risks for their full price from the date of delivery;</p>

<p><b>9.3.6</b> give M Squared such information relating to Goods as M Squared may require from time to time, but Customer may resell or use Goods in the ordinary course of its business.</p>

<p><b>9.4</b> If before title to Goods passes to Customer, Customer becomes subject to any of the events listed in clause 7.1, or M Squared reasonably believes that any such event is about to happen and notifies Customer accordingly, then, provided that Goods have not been resold, or irrevocably incorporated into another product, and without limiting any other right or remedy M Squared may have, M Squared may at any time require Customer to deliver up Goods and, if Customer fails to do so promptly, enter any premises of Customer or of any third party where Goods are stored in order to recover them.</p>

<p><b>9.5</b> The provisions of this clause 9 shall apply in so far as recognised by the jurisdiction in question and enforceable thereunder, to the intent that M Squared, until it has received payment in full, shall retain the maximum of rights and powers in relation to Goods against Customer and any other party who has dealing with Goods.</p>

<h3>10. TERMS OF PAYMENT</h3>
<p><b>10.1</b> The price of Goods shall be the price set out in the Order, or, if no price is quoted, the price set out in M Squared’s published price list in force as at the date of delivery. </p>
<p><b>10.2</b> M Squared may, by giving notice to Customer at any time up to 5 Business Days before delivery, increase the price of Goods to reflect any increase in the cost of Goods that is due to:</li>

<p><b>10.2.2</b> any request by Customer to change the delivery date(s), quantities or types of Goods ordered, or the Specification; or </p>
<p><b>10.2.3</b> any delay caused by any instructions of Customer or failure of Customer to give M Squared adequate or accurate information or instructions.  </p>

<p><b>10.3</b> The price of Goods is inclusive of the costs and charges of packaging, insurance and transport of Goods.</p>

<p><b>10.4</b>  The price of Goods is exclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax (VAT) or other applicable sales tax. Customer shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from M Squared, pay to M Squared such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of Goods.</p>

<p><b>10.8</b>   Customer shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any deduction or withholding except as required by law and Customer shall not be entitled to assert any credit, set-off or counterclaim against M Squared in order to justify withholding payment of any such amount in whole or in part.

<h3>11. CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<p><b>11.1</b>  Customer shall keep in strict confidence all technical or commercial know-how, specifications, inventions, processes or initiatives which are of a confidential nature and have been disclosed to Customer by M Squared, its employees, agents, consultants or subcontractors and any other confidential information concerning M Squared’s business or its products which Customer may obtain.</p> 

<p><b>11.2</b>  Customer may disclose such information:</p>

<p><b>11.2.1</b> to its employees, officers, representatives, advisers, agents or subcontractors who need to know such information for the purposes of carrying out Customer’s obligations under the Contract or in utilising Goods; and </p>

<p><b>11.2.2</b> as may be required by law, court order or any governmental or regulatory authority.</p>

<p><b>11.3</b> Customer shall use its best endeavours to ensure that its employees, officers, representatives, advisers, agents or subcontractors to whom it discloses such information comply with this clause 11.</p> 

<p><b>11.4</b> Customer acknowledges that violations of the covenants and obligations in this clause 11 may cause M Squared irreparable injury for which an adequate remedy at law may not be available. Therefore, M Squared shall be entitled to seek all remedies that may be available including immediate injunctive relief, in addition to whatever remedies may be available at law.</p>

<h3>12. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h3>
<p><b>12.1</b> As between Customer and M Squared, all Intellectual Property Rights and all other rights in Goods (including the Specification) shall be owned by and automatically vest in M Squared. M Squared licenses such Intellectual Property Rights to Customer free of charge and on a non-exclusive, worldwide basis to such extent as is necessary to enable Customer to make reasonable use of Goods. If the Contract is terminated for cause due to Customer’s default, this licence will automatically terminate.</p>

<p><b>12.2</b> In respect of Software, in the event that there is any conflict between this clause 12 and the Software Licence, the terms of the Software Licence shall prevail.</p> 

<h3>13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
<p><b>13.1 This clause 13 sets out the entire financial liability of M Squared (including any liability for the acts or omissions of its employees, agents, consultants and subcontractors) to Customer in respect of:</b></p>

<p><b>13.1.1 any breach of the Contract however arising;</b></p> 

<p><b>13.1.2 any use made by Customer of Goods or any part of them; and </b></p> 

<p><b>13.1.3 any representation, statement or tortious act or omission (including negligence) arising under or in connection with the Contract.</b></p>

<p><b>13.2 All warranties, conditions and other terms implied by statute or common law are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the Contract.</b></p>

<p><b>13.3 Nothing in the Contract limits or excludes the liability of M Squared:</b></p>

<p><b>13.3.1 for death or personal injury resulting from its negligence;</b></p> 

<p><b>13.3.2  fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</b></p>

<p><b>13.3.3  any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for M Squared to exclude or restrict liability.</b></p>

<h3>13.4</b>  Subject to clause 13.3:</h3>

<p><b>13.4.1</b>  M Squared shall not under any circumstances whatever be liable for:  </p>

<p><b>13.4.2 M Squared’s total liability in contract, delict/tort (including negligence or breach of statutory duty), misrepresentation, restitution or otherwise arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Contract shall in all circumstances not exceed 135% of the price paid for Goods.
</b></p>



<h3>14. EXPORT CONTROL</h3>
<p><b>14.1</b> To the extent that Goods are intended to be supplied and exported outside the European Community from within the European Community, Goods will only be supplied and exported by M Squared to the intent that M Squared can obtain a valid export licence in respect thereto and furthermore meet any applicable export control conditions in respect thereto.
</p>
<p><b>14.2</b> Customer agrees that it will not export or re-export Goods or associated documentation in any form without obtaining (i) an applicable governmental or other required export licences and (ii) the written consent of M Squared. Failure to comply with this provision is a material breach of these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h3>15. EXPIRATION AND TERMINATION</h3>

<p><b>15.1 Termination for Cause.</b>  Either party will have the right to terminate the Contract if the other party breaches any material term of the Contract (including the applicable Order Acknowledgement) and if such breach is capable of cure, the breaching party fails to cure such breach within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof. Either party will have the right to terminate the Contract if the other becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a trustee or receiver is appointed for such other party or for a substantial part of its assets, or bankruptcy, reorganisation or insolvency proceedings shall be instituted by or against such other party, or an event occurs, or proceedings are taken, with respect to either party in any jurisdiction to which it is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any events mentioned in this clause 15. For the avoidance of doubt, termination of the Contract under this clause 15 terminates the applicable Order Acknowledgement and all licenses granted by M Squared to Customer as part of the Contract.</p>

<p><b>15.2 Effect of Termination.</b>  On termination or expiration of the Contract for any reason other than breach caused solely by M Squared: </p>

<p><b>15.2.1</b> Customer shall immediately pay to M Squared all of M Squared’s outstanding unpaid invoices and interest and, in respect of Goods supplied (or the circumstances in clause 6.1 occurring) but for which no invoice has been submitted, M Squared may submit an invoice, which shall be payable immediately by Customer on receipt;</p> 


<p><b>15.2.2</b> the accrued rights, remedies, obligations and liabilities of the parties as at termination shall not be affected, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Contract which existed at or before the date of termination; and</p> 

<p><b>15.2.3</b> clauses which expressly or by implication have effect after termination shall continue in full force and effect, including the following clauses: clause 11 (Confidentiality), clause 12 (Intellectual Property Rights), clause 13 (Limitation of Liability), clause 15.2.3, clause 16.3 (Governing law and Jurisdiction) and clause 16.6 (Notices).</p>

<h3>16. GENERAL</h3>
<p><b>16.1 Marketing.</b> Unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Acknowledgement, Customer agrees that M Squared may use Customer’s name and logo (in a form Customer approves) to identify Customer as a customer on M Squared’s website or in marketing or publicity materials.</p>

<p><b>16.2 Transfer of Rights and Obligations.</b> Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of M Squared, assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract, or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Contract. M Squared may at any time assign, transfer, charge, mortgage, subcontract, or deal in any other manner with all or any of its rights or obligations under the Contract. Each party that has rights under the Contract is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of another person.</p>

<p><b>16.3 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</b> The Contract and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Law of Scotland. The parties irrevocably agree that the courts of Scotland shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the Contract or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</p> 

<p><b>16.3  Nonexclusive Remedy.</b> Except as expressly set forth in the Contract, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Contract will be without prejudice to its other remedies under the Contract or otherwise.</li>

<p><b>16.4 Force Majeure.</b> Neither party will be responsible for any failure or delay in its performance under the Contract (except for any payment obligations) due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, labour disputes, strikes, lockouts, shortages of or inability to obtain labour, energy, raw materials or supplies, war, terrorism, riot, natural disasters or governmental action.</p>

<p><b>16.5 Notices.</b> All notices required or permitted under the Contract will be in writing. Any notice shall be deemed to have been duly received: (a) if delivered personally, when left at the address; (b) if sent by pre-paid first-class post or recorded delivery, at 9.00 am on the second Business Day after posting; or (c) if delivered by commercial courier, on the date and at the time that the courier’s delivery receipt is signed. Notices relating to the Contract will be sent to the primary corporate addresses set forth in the applicable Order Acknowledgement or to such other address as Customer or M Squared may notify the other party in writing.</p>

<p><b>16.6  Entire Agreement.</b>The Contract, including the applicable Order Acknowledgement referencing these Terms and Conditions, constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between Customer and M Squared regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, relating to its subject matter. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into the Contract it does not rely on any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether it was made negligently or innocently) of any person (whether a party to the Contract or not) <b>(Representation)</b> other than as expressly set out in the Contract. Each party agrees that the only rights and remedies available to it arising out of or in connection with a Representation shall be for breach of contract. Nothing in this clause 16.7 shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud.</p>

<p><b>16.7 Modification; Severability.</b> Failure to enforce any provision of the Contract will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of the Contract will be effective only if in writing and signed by an officer of Customer and an authorised representative of M Squared. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Contract invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of the Contract will remain in full force and effect.</p> 

<p><b>16.8  No Partnership or Agency.</b> Nothing in the Contract is intended to, or shall operate to, create a partnership between the parties, or to authorise either party to act as agent for the other, and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).</p>
