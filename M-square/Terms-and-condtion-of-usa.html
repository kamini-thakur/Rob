                           <ol><li>These Terms and Conditions apply to the Agreement to the exclusion of any other terms that Customer seeks to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.</li>

                            <li> Customer is responsible for ensuring that the terms of the Order Form and any applicable Specifications are complete and accurate.</li>

                            <li>The Agreement shall only be deemed to be effective once each party has duly signed the Order Form.</li>

                            <li> Any samples, drawings, descriptive matter, advertising or any other materials produced by or on behalf of M Squared USA, including any descriptions or illustrations contained in M Squared USA’s catalogues or brochures, are provided for the sole purpose of giving an approximate idea of goods described in them. They shall not form part of the Agreement or have any contractual force. </li>
                            </ol>
                            <h1>4. CREDIT APPROVAL</h1>
                            <ol><li> Unless otherwise agreed in writing between M Squared USA and Customer, effectiveness of the Agreement is subject to the condition that M Squared USA obtains satisfactory credit approval from its credit insurers for such Order. In the event such approval is not granted, in terms which M Squared USA in its sole discretion considers satisfactory, M Squared USA may by notice in writing intimate to Customer that such condition has not been satisfied. In that event M Squared USA shall not in any circumstances incur any liability to Customer in respect of any matters directly or indirectly related to such Order.</li>

                            </ol>
                            <h1>5. DELIVERY</h1>
                            <ol>
                            <li>M Squared USA shall ensure that:</li>

                            <li>each delivery of Goods is accompanied by a delivery note which shows the date of the Order, all relevant Customer and M Squared USA reference numbers, the type and quantity of Goods (including the code number of Goods, where applicable), special storage instructions (if any) and, if the Order is being delivered by instalments, the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered; and</li>

                            <li>if M Squared USA requires Customer to return any packaging materials to M Squared USA, that fact is clearly stated on the delivery note. Customer shall make any such packaging materials available for collection at such times as M Squared USA shall reasonably request. Returns of packaging materials shall be at the M Squared USA’s expense.</li>

                            <li> M Squared USA shall deliver Goods to the location set out in the Order or such other location as the parties may agree in writing (the “Delivery Address”) at any time after M Squared USA notifies Customer that Goods are ready to be dispatched, shipped and delivered to Customer.</li>

                            <li> Delivery of Goods shall be completed upon Goods’ arrival at the Delivery Address.</li>

                            <li>Any dates quoted for delivery of Goods are approximate only, and the time of delivery of Goods is not of the essence. M Squared USA shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of Goods that is due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, labour disputes, strikes, lockouts, shortages of or inability to obtain labor, energy, raw materials or supplies, war, terrorism, riot, natural disasters or governmental action (a “Force Majeure Event”) or Customer’s failure to provide M Squared USA with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of Goods.</li>

                            <li> If M Squared USA fails to deliver Goods in accordance with the Agreement, its liability shall be limited to M Squared USA refunding Customer cost of Goods already paid. This shall be Customer’s sole remedy in the case of M Squared USA’s failure to deliver Goods.</li>

                            <li> If Customer fails to take delivery of Goods within three (3) Business Days of M Squared USA notifying Customer that Goods are ready for delivery pursuant to Section 5.2, then, except where such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event or M Squared USA’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Agreement:</li>

Notices relating to the Agreement will be sent to the primary corporate addresses set forth in the applicable Order Acknowledgement or to such other address as Customer or M Squared USA may notify the other party in writing.</li>

                            <li> <b>Entire Agreement.</b> The Agreement, including the applicable Order Form referencing these Terms and Conditions, constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between Customer and M Squared USA regarding its subject matter and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, relating to its subject matter.</li>

                            <li> <b>Modification;</b> Severability. Failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any waiver, modification or amendment of the Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by an officer of Customer and an authorised representative of M Squared USA. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Agreement invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be restated so as to effect as near as possible the original intention of the invalid provision and the other provisions of the Agreement will remain unchanged and in full force and effect.</li>

                            <li> <b>No Partnership or Agency.</b> Nothing in the Agreement is intended to, or shall operate to, create a partnership between the parties, or to authorise either party to act as agent for the other, and neither party shall have authority to act in the name or on behalf of or otherwise to bind the other in any way (including the making of any representation or warranty, the assumption of any obligation or liability and the exercise of any right or power).
