Hello Support

My mailchimp account is with avishay@danya.co.il

I am having some problem in mailchimp integration with shopify.
I have integrated mailchimp with my shopify store http://gadecosmetics.com/

The customers who accepts email marketing are not listed in mailchimp list. However this was working fine before. Not sure what went wrong.
Can you please check and confirm ?

Hope to hear back from you soon.

Thanks

Hello.  I will be happy to answer any possible quesitons
web expert
Thanks. Please check and confirm why its not working
Derius
So with what you are subscribing, it normally means something has changed at some point.  There is not a lot that would be visible in that situation.
I am assuming that they are being saved in shopify?
web expert
Yes, we have simply used shopify customer form
Derius
In this situation, it is recommended that you disconnect and reconnect.  Before you do so, let me take a look at a couple things from the admin side
web expert
When an customer register, they automatically accept email marketing(So that by this option they should be listed in mailchimp list as well)
Right ?
This is working on other shopify store integration with mailchimp
Derius
Yes they should be visible within normally a couple minutes
Sounds like some kind of disconnection.  Especially if it was working before
Do you have a sample email address that I can check into
I also want to check double vs single opt-in as well to make sure they are not inlimbo
in limbo
web expert
yes, i do. Let me share it with you

Okay
Derius
Neither of these show as subscribed or pending subscription. Looks like you will need to disconnect and connect your shopify.  Everything looks normal on the admin side, so disconnecting and reconnecting normally resets the connection
web expert
Okay. I will check it after resetting connection

Derius
Ok.  That new connection should show on our side.  And we should be able to see the subscribers come over
web expert
However both the emails accepts email marketing
Okay. I will check it after resetting connection
Derius
Yes.  Sounds like its not being pushed to MailChimp
Has the sync completed?
web expert
Yes
But id doesn't seem to be working
I have registered with this email test444@gmail.com
Accept marketing true option is set
But its still not showing in mailchimp list
Derius
To verify are you actually signing up for an account on your website or what steps are you currently taking
web expert
Yes, we are simply signing up as customer in shopify
This creates customer in shopify
And there is settings in admin, customer will be automatically added to mailchimp list
The option which is required to make this work is true (Accept email marketing)
But still customer are not showing in mailing list
However if use same steps on other store, its working fine
Derius
Thanks.  Taking a look
web expert
okay
Derius
Do you have the ability to do a test purchase?
web expert
No i dont
This is a client store and i am the developer
Derius
Ok.  Normally the disconnect, reconnect resolves it.  I see you did do so correctly.  Since it did not work, it is recommended that you work with one of our e-commerce specialists
In order to do so I would have to convert this chat to email and send you to their queue and the next available agent can reach out to email
web expert
Great
I will be waiting for the sooner response
You cans send me email back on this : webexpert4esfera@gmail.com
Derius
Great.  That was the next thing I was going to verify
Perfect.  I am sending this ticket over to them now and the next available agent will email you directly
web expert
Okay. Thanks for your help :)
Derius
Thanks.  Have a great day.  Our team will talk to you soon
web expert
Same to you. Thanks. I will be waiting
Derius
Thanks
Bye
web expert
