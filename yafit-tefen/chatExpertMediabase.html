Shivani can you check with your team and let me know what the price would be for a app like this for iphone / with exacly the same functions: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vanywhere/id1162055025?ls=1&mt=8
we dont need a Wallet - customers must be able to register as experts and if sombody whants advice he has to be able to pay - best using apple pay

okay let me checkSent on:TueI have gone through the app and according to my analysis you need an app through which user could contact to different skilled persons through one to one call,video call,live, one to one call etc. The user has to pay a specific amount that the person charges for a minute and choose the mode of media.It will take about 4-5 weeks to complete this app with same functionalities using third party api's for communication media's like quickblox etc.
Question:- You will purchase the account for third party api's like quickblox?

yes we would buy the third pary apps. you have done applications like this before?

No we haven't but we have knowledge about the sameSent on:TueSo we can make it

so you build simular apps or mor IOS apps allready right?

Even we can work on 3rd party those provide the same feature like quickbloxSent on:TueWe have implemented that 3rd party into the AppBut we haven't made the exact similar App like you are requesting 

ok I seeSent on:TueFrom:mediabaseso around 160 - 200 hours right

Shivani can we programm the app so we can also display information (experts) from the app in a widget on a website:A example would be we have 3 persons that know about baby food so we would build a shopify app that would show next to the prodct that we have 3 expert for that topic and thy could contact them and see if thy are online or what they charge for advice... We dont have to do that in the start but we neet to build it so it is possibel - but I dont htink this is an issue because we just pull it out of the database right?

It works like when some one wants suggestions from expert on my product then they can directly contact with themSent on:TueAnd the expert will be register as per product expertise Am I right

yes it should work just in the app so person to person but I also want companys to give the option to put it on ther website but this can be the scond step - I just want to make sure it will work later if we watn to do that

Yes it will work

ok sounds good please tell me the e-mail of the person how will work on it so i can send a hubstuff invite link and then lets start
